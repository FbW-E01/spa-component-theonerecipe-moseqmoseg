        Mix the milk and vinegar and let it sit for a minute or two (you’re

        butter into the dry ingredients until just combined.

        Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Melt a little smear of butter in
        the pan (essential for giving a yummy golden brown crust).
      </li>
      <li className="stepitem">
        Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the hot skillet and spread it
        flat-like (it will be pretty thick). Arrange a few blueberries on top.
        Cook until you see little bubbles on top and the edges starting to firm
        up. Flip and cook for another 1-2 minutes until the pancakes are
        sky-high fluffy and cooked through.

        Serve with butter and maple syrup. But honestly, sometimes I just like
        to eat these plain. YUM, YUM, YUM.
